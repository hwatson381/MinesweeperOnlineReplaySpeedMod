### How to install
1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/hwatson381/MinesweeperOnlineReplaySpeedMod/releases/latest)  
2. Download the bookmarks file replaySpeedMod.html and import it as a bookmark - see this gif for a quick way to do this in chrome https://gyazo.com/397a7cf074b3ae0405d849dfb0477511
3. Go to a minesweeper.online replay (e.g. https://minesweeper.online/game/979010776 ) and click the bookmark
4. Move the slider around to adjust how fast the game is played back

### Alternate instructions (not recommended).
The version in the releases page can be updated automatically if it breaks (which it probably will).
If you don't want this, you can either make a bookmarklet yourself from faster-replays.js or use the replaySpeedModFixedVersion.html file in this repo.
